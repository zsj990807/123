## Introduction

üåü Considering the characteristics of multivariate time series, iTransformer breaks the conventional structure without modifying any Transformer modules. **Inverted Transformer is all you need in MTSF**.

üèÜ iTransformer achieves the comprehensive state-of-the-art in challenging multivariate forecasting tasks and solves several pain points of Transformer on extensive time series data.

## Overall Architecture

iTransformer regards **independent time series as variate tokens** to **capture multivariate correlations by attention** and **utilize layernorm and feed-forward networks to learn series representations**.

The pseudo-code of iTransformer is as simple as the following:

</p>

## Usage 

1. Install Pytorch and necessary dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. The datasets can be obtained from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l51QsKvQPcqILT3DwfjCgx8Dsg2rpjot/view?usp=drive_link) or [Tsinghua Cloud](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/2ea5ca3d621e4e5ba36a/).

2. Train and evaluate the model. We provide all the above tasks under the folder ./scripts/. You can reproduce the results as the following examples:

```
# Multivariate forecasting with iTransformer
bash ./scripts/multivariate_forecasting/Traffic/iTransformer.sh

# Compare the performance of Transformer and iTransformer
bash ./scripts/boost_performance/Weather/iTransformer.sh

# Train the model with partial variates, and generalize on the unseen variates
bash ./scripts/variate_generalization/ECL/iTransformer.sh

# Test the performance on the enlarged lookback window
bash ./scripts/increasing_lookback/Traffic/iTransformer.sh

# Utilize FlashAttention for acceleration
bash ./scripts/efficient_attentions/iFlashTransformer.sh
```

## Main Result of Multivariate Forecasting

We evaluate the iTransformer on challenging multivariate forecasting benchmarks (**generally hundreds of variates**). **Comprehensive good performance** (MSE/MAE $\downarrow$) is achieved.

## General Performance Boosting on Transformers

By introducing the proposed framework, Transformer and its variants achieve **significant performance improvement**, demonstrating the **generality of the iTransformer approach** and **benefiting from efficient attention mechanisms**.

</p>

## Zero-Shot Generalization on Variates

**Technically, iTransformer is able to forecast with arbitrary numbers of variables**. We train iTransformers on partial variates and forecast unseen variates with good generalizability.

## Model Analysis

Benefiting from inverted Transformer modules: 

- (Left) Inverted Transformers learn **better time series representations** (more similar [CKA](https://github.com/jayroxis/CKA-similarity)) favored by forecasting.
- (Right) The inverted self-attention module learns **interpretable multivariate correlations**.
